Under the FAQ, add 3 unordered lists like above. Each list should contain a national park name in an h3 element, and a ul of 4 facts about the park.

Create a button that, when clicked, makes the last li in each ul have a yellow background.

When any h3 is clicked, the lis underneath it should be bolded. Use fontWeight = "bold" to achieve this. Hint: you should use this in the event listener to access the next sibling of the h3 that is clicked. Also, an h3 is like an aunt or uncle to its corresponding lis

When any list item is clicked, first li of the parent ul should have a font color of blue. Hint: you should again rely on this in the li event handler.

Bonus
Create 3 divs that each look like a picture frame. Each one should have a unique background image and a button underneath that swaps the image from the frame. Use traversing properties to accomplish this.

The rules are the following:

When the left picture's button is clicked, the left and center picture swap images.
When the center picture's button is clicked, the center picture swaps randomly with either the left OR right frames.
When the right picture's button is clicked, the right and center pictures swap images.
Hint: swap the values of the images' src attributes.
